SeqPig is a library of import and export functions for file formats
commonly used in bioinformatics for Apache Pig. Additionally, it provides a
collection of Pig user-defined functions (UDF's) that allow for processing
of aligned and unaligned sequence data. Currently SeqPig supports BAM/SAM,
FastQ and Qseq input and output. It is built on top of the Hadoop-BAM
library. Fore more information see

Releases of SeqPig come bundled with Picard/Samtools, which were developed at
the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and Biodoop/Seal, which were developed
at the Center for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia. See
