 ** V0.2 **

   - AS: tried to improve bash scripts for import and export of bam/sam
   - AS: support for sam, qseq and fastq added
   - AS: first version of samtools compatible pileup (although currently with
     disabled base quality re-calibration, option -B for samtools)
   - many more examples in the readme and some (hopefully) more useful
     setup instructions.
